# Libft
The project's aim is to create a custom C library by recoding functions of the C standard library and additional utility functions. The main purpose of Libft is to understand basic programming concepts.

## Key Concepts
- Data structures
- String manipulation
- Memory manipulation
- Working with linked lists



## How To Use

### Memory manipulation functions
### Linked lists functions

## Remarks
Most of these functions are already implemented and available to us from the C standard library, so you might ask yourselves, why spending the time to recode these functions? That was my question too, but it slowly became obvious why. By trying to understand and recode these basic functions, I learned
